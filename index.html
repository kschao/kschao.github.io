	      I am currently a student at DevCodeCamp and seeking pursue my career in Computer Science.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I am learning each day as I code, I tend to find my niche in Python, SQL, and more of the front-end side.&nbsp; As an entry-level software developer, I enjoy coding, <br>
	      testing, and integration. I’ve always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me. Although my professional path has&nbsp;</p>
    <p>taken many twists and turns — from working in the banking industry for the last 7 years. As a Software Developer, I get a kick out of combining my unequivocal&nbsp;</p>
	    <p>attention to detail, obvious passion for creating, and mission-driven work ethic to truly change the world. This is why I look forward to making a significant contribution at a fast-growing industry.&nbsp;</p>
